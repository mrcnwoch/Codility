    "A stack machine is a simple system that performs arithmetic operations on an input string of numbers and operators. It contains a stack that can store an arbitrary number of 12-bit unsigned integers. Initially the stack is empty. The machine processes a string of characters in the following way:\n",
    "\n",
    "•\tthe characters of the string are processed one by one;\n",
    "\n",
    "•\tif the current character is a digit (‘0’-‘9’), the machine pushes the value of that digit onto its stack;\n",
    "\n",
    "•\tif the current character is ‘+’, the machine pops the two topmost values from its stack, adds them and pushes the result onto the stack;\n",
    "\n",
    "•\tif the current character is ‘*’, the machine pops the two topmost values from its stack, multiplies them and pushes the result onto the stack;\n",
    "\n",
    "•\tafter the machine has processed the whole string it returns the topmost value of its stack as the result;\n",
    "\n",
    "•\tthe machine reports an error if any operation it performs (addition or multiplication) results in an overflow;\n",
    "\n",
    "•\tthe machine reports an error if it tries to pop an element from its stack when the stack is empty, or if the stack is empty after the machine has processed the whole string.\n",
